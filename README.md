# Train 11+ app

This app allows you to practise vocabulary for the 11+ exam. I may add Maths questions in the future.

Todo:
* Ability to indicate whether you knew the meaning, keep statistics
* Ability to select training set (e.g. tricky ones)
* Ability to set word type (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, multiple) and show background in appropriate colour (save the alternating CSS)
* Disable buttons while submitting is taking place
* Pagination
* View by type on home view (e.g. only nouns)
* Ability to add antonyms
* Maybe remove shadow and buttons from home view (just click to edit?)
