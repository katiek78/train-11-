# Train 11+ app

This app allows you to practise vocabulary for the 11+ exam. I may add Maths questions in the future.

Todo:
* "New Word" button in Train mode
* Ability to indicate whether you knew the meaning, keep statistics
* Ability to select training set (e.g. tricky ones)
* Ability to set word type (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, multiple) and show background in appropriate colour (save the alternating CSS)
